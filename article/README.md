# ML Zoomcamp Article: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

This folder contains the "article" (lol) for the DataTalks.Club Machine Learning Zoomcamp.

Because of its size, it has been divided in 2 parts:

1. [Part 1: this document explains the main theory behind Reinforcement Learning.](1_intro.md)
1. Part 2: this Jupyter notebook contains an example of solving a RL task using Deep Q-Learning.
    * [Run the notebook in Google Colab (recommended)](http://colab.research.google.com/github/ziritrion/ml-zoomcamp/blob/main/article/2_dql.ipynb)
    * [Link to the notebook in GitHub.](2_dql.ipynb)
