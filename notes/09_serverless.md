# Intro to Serverless Deep Learning

![intro](images/09_d01.png)

***Serverless*** is the concept of removing infrastructure considerations for deploying code. Instead of having to manage servers and infrastructure by ourselves, a serverless service takes care of that for us and only charges according to use.

We will use ***AWS Lambda*** for this session. Even though it's serverless, we will have to use Docker to package our model and serve predictions.

***WARNING:*** _Docker images are architecture-dependent. If you're using an ARM computer such as Apple Silicon Macbooks, the following steps may not work._

# AWS Lambda

***Lambda*** is a service from Amazon Web Services that allows us to run code without having to think about server infrastructure. The advantage is that you're only charged when your code is being run, unlike traditional servers, which are payed for according to uptime. Your code can be deployed and you won't be charged anything on low activity periods when the code is not running.

## Setting up a new Lambda function

When creating a new Lambda function, you must choose the following:
* **Function name**: self explanatory
* **Runtime**: language of your function and associated runtime. Lambda supports multiple languages, including Python (up to Python 3.9 at the time of writing these notes).
* **Architecture**: either _x86_64_ or _arm64_. We'll stick with _x86_64_ for this course (refer to the warning in the first section).
* **Permissions**: permissions for triggers, logs and other advanced uses.

After choosing the parameters, an IDE will appear on screen for writing your function and tests.

## Sample Lambda function

    import json

    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        print("parameters:", event)
        url = event['url']
        results = event['prediction'] + 1
        return results

* `event` contains all the necessary info to use inside our function. An ***event*** is a JSON-formatted document that the Lambda runtime converts to an object and passes it to our function. The object is usually of type `dict` (as in this example) but it can be `list`, `str`, `int` `float` or `None`.
* `context` can contain methods and properties that provide information about the invocation, function and runtime environment. We will ignore this parameter for this course.

Once your code is finished, you must ***deploy*** it with the Deploy button at the top.

## Sample test event

A ***test event*** is a way to test our lambda function. Each function can have up to 10 test events. As mentioned before, an _event_ is a JSON document.

    {
        "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
        "prediction": 69
    }

In this example, once we use the Test button, Lambda will send this JSON document to our function in the form of a Python `dict` with 2 keys: `url` and `prediction`, which are used in the example code above.

You can assign a name to a test event to save it for multiple uses.

# TensorFlow Lite

***TensorFlow Lite*** (TFL) is a version of TensorFlow used for **inference** _only_. You cannot train new models with it, but you can predict results. This is useful for deployment as TFL is much smaller than the full version of the framework, thus making it possible to do inference on environments such as mobile or cloud, where storage and computing resources are either limited or expensive.

## Convert a Keras model to TF-Lite

Converting an existing Keras model to TF-Lite is pretty straightforward.

    import tensorflow as tf

    converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)

    tflite_model = converter.convert()

    with open('model.tflite', 'wb') as f_out:
        f.write(tflite_model)

You simply create a `converter` object trained on your model, then convert the model and store it to a file for later use.

## Using a TF-Lite model

Using a TF-Lite model is slightly more involved than a simple Keras model, because Keras is a wrapper around TensorFlow which we don't have when dealing with TF-Lite directly.

    import tensorflow.lite as tflite

    interpreter = tflite.Interpreter(model_path='tflite.model')
    interpreter.allocate_tensors()

* We first create an `interpreter` object that loads the model from a file.
* Then we load the weights of the model with the `allocate_tensors()` method. Keras loads the weights automatically but we must do so manually in TF-Lite.

Keras takes care of managing the inputs and outputs of the model for us, but TF-Lite does not.

`interpreter.get_input_details()` will give us all the details about the model's input; `interpreter.get_output_details()` will do the same for the outputs. We're interested in accessing the ***indices*** of both the input and the output. In our example, the output of both functions returns a dictionary list with a single dictionary each because our model only has one input and one output, so we can access the `index` key on each and store it:

    input_index = interpreter.get_input_details()[0]['index']
    output_index = interpreter.get_output_details()[0]['index']

With our stored indices, we can now set the input, do inference and get our predictions:

    interpreter.set_tensor(input_index, X)

    interpreter.invoke()

    preds = interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)

* `set_tensor()` takes the input we want to predict on and the input index and sets up the model for inference.
* `invoke()` does the inference.
* `get_tensor()` with `output_index` grabs the output of the model, which contains the predictions.

## Removing TF dependencies (image processing)

In the code above we're still loading the full TensorFlow library and we still need to access the image preprocessing functions that live in the TF libraries in order to preprocess our input.

Regarding image preprocessing, so far we've seen code similar to this:

    from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img
    from tensorflow.keras.applications.xception import preprocess_input
    
    img = load_img('image.jpg', target_size=(299,299))

    x = np.array(img)
    X = np.array([x])

    X = preprocess_input(X)

We can replace `load_img()` with a similar function from `PIL` and we can reimplement `preprocess_input()` easily, thus getting rid of TF dependencies:

    from PIL import Image

    with Image.open('image.jpg') as img:
        img = img.resize((299, 299), Image.NEAREST)
    
    def preprocess_input(x):
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    x = np.array(img, dtype='float32')
    X = np.array([x])

    X = preprocess_input(X)


* In `img.resize()`, `NEAREST` is the interpolation method we use for resizing, which also happens to be the default.
* By looking at Keras' source code, we're able to see that `preprocess_input()` does a very simple transformation to our input which we can implement in a simple function in our code.
* When converting the image to an array, we convert it to `float32` in order to avoid errors.

Alternatively, there's a library, `keras-image-helper`,  which contains preprocessors for a few convnets. Install it with `!pip install keras-image-helper`.

    from keras_image_helper import create_preprocessor

    preprocessor = create_preprocessor('xception', target_size(299, 299))
    X = preprocessor.from_path('image.jpg')

## Removing TF dependencies (runtime)

In order to finally remove all TF dependencies, we must install `tflite_runtime`.

`!pip install --extra-index-url https://google-coral.github.io/py-repo/ tflite_runtime`

We can now import it as a drop-in replacement for TF:

    import tflite_runtime.interpreter as tflite

And use all the code from the previous sections.

# Exporting code for Lambda

*Aside: you can convert Jupyter Notebooks to Python scripts with a built-in command line utility: `jupyter nbconvert --to script 'notebook.ipynb'`*

Once you've got a TFLite model working, you can create a Lambda script with a `lambda_handler()` method that calls a `predict()` function that contains your code.

We cannot import our model object directly to Lambda, but we can upload a Docker image instead that contains our `lambda_function.py` and our dependencies.

# Preparing a Docker image

We can use a publicly available Lambda Python base image from Amazon as our base image and add our code on it.

***WARNING:*** _Amazon Linux images are CentOS based; using code that has been tested on Debian-based distros may not work due to different available libraries and dependencies._

    FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.8

    RUN pip3 install keras_image_helper
    RUN pip3 install https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda/raw/main/tflite/tflite_runtime-2.7.0-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl

    COPY model.tflite .
    COPY lambda_function.py .

    CMD ["lambda_function.lambda_handler"]

* `public.ecr.aws` is a URL that contains all publicly available Docker images from Amazon.
* We do not use `pipenv` in this Dockerfile because it's difficult to make it work with TensorFlow.
* TensorFlow's available package on `pip` is made for Debian-based distros and will not work on our image. We need to recompile TensorFlow for our image. Luckily, there are available precompiled images on [Alexey Grigorev's Repo](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda).
    * `Wheel` is a built-package format supported by `pip`. Instead of downloading a package from pip's repo, we directly install a wheel from a URL.
* We don't need an entrypoint in this Docker image; instead we just call our `lambda_handler()` function inside the `lambda_function.py` script.

***WARNING:*** _Lambda requires that the output of `lambda_handler()` be serializable in order to convert it to JSON and send them back to the user. The code from previous sections returns numpy arrays of type `float32`, which are not serializable by the JSON library. This issue can easily be solved by converting a numpy array to a Python list with the `tolist()` method or by casting each `float32` value to Python floats with `float()`._

If you want to test the image, the URL for accessing the method in the Docker image is `http://localhost:8080/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations`.

# Creating the Lambda function

Once you've generated a working Docker image, you can publish it to Lambda by selecting _Container image_ in the _Create function_ options. You must first upload the image to _Elastic Container Registry_ (ECR) and then copy the resulting URL and paste it in Lambda.

## Uploading to ECR (CLI)

You can install the AWS CLI tool with `pip install awscli`.

1. Create a registry in ECR
    * `aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-registry`
    * The output of this command will contain the registry URL. Copy it.
1. Get the login info for the repo
    * `aws ecr get-login --no-include-email`
    * This will output a new command that you can use to login to the repo.
        * Your password will be visible in plain text. If you are sharing your screen, you can use `sed` to parse the text and change the output.
        * `aws ecr get-login --no-include-email | sed 's/[0-9a-zA-Z=]\{20,\}/PASSWORD/g'`
            * `sed` will parse the text and look for a string of length 20 containing numbers, upper and lowercase letters and the `=` sign, and replace it with the word `PASSWORD`.
1. Login to the repo. 2 ways:
    1. Copy the output of the previous command.
    1. Use this trick to use the output of a command as the actual command:
        * `$(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email)`
1. Create the `REMOTE_URI` of your image by attaching a ***tag*** to the end of the repo URL preceded by a colon.
    * Consider the example URL `123456.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/my-registry`.
        * `123456` is the ***account***.
        * `dkr.ecr` means that the URL belongs to an Amazon ECR private registry.
        * `eu-west-1` is the ***region***.
        * `amazonaws.com` is the top domain.
        * `/my-registry` is the directory of the registry we created in step 1.
    * A _tag_ is a name you assign to the specific version of the image in use. For our example we'll use `model-001`.
    * The resulting `REMOTE_URI` is `123456.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/my-registry:model-001`
1. Tag your latest Docker image with the `REMOTE_URI`
    * `docker tag my-model-image:latest ${REMOTE_URI}`
1. Push the image
    * `docker push ${REMOTE_URI}`

## Finishing the setup on Lambda's Control Panel

Back in Lambda's Control Panel website, select _Container image_, give it a name and paste the `REMOTE_URI` into the _Container image URI_, or select it after clicking on _Browse images_ (if you do this, Amazon will paste a _digest_ of the image rather than the URI, but the end result is the same). Leave the default `x86_64` architecture as it is.

You may need to increase the timeout default value. You can do so on the _Configuration_ tab > _General configuration_ > _Edit_ button > _Timeout_. You may also need to increase the available RAM memory; you can do so from the same submenu as timeout.

Make sure to test your function with the _Test_ tab.

## Pricing

Lambda charges you each time that your `lambda_handler` method is called; specifically, it charges by millisecond of use. Pricing may vary depending on the chosen region and selected memory.

# Exposing the Lambda function (API Gateway)

***API Gateway*** is another AWS service for creating and exposing APIs.

1. Create a new REST API. Give it a name and create it. This will open a _Resources_ menu.
1. Create a new resource. Give it a name as well (usually something like `predict`) and create it.
1. Create a new _Method_ inside your resource. Choose the HTTP method you need (we'll use `POST` for this example). Select it to open its Setup options
    * Set _Integration type_ to _Lambda Function_.
    * Set _Lambda Region_ to your chosen region.
    * Choose your Lambda Function.
    * Use the Default Timeout and uncheck _Lambda Proxy integration_.
1. Test the gateway by clicking on _Test_.
    * Write a JSON document in _Request Body_ for testing.
1. After successful testing, deploy the API.
    1. Click on the _Actions_ button on top and choose Deploy API
    1. Assign a _Stage name_ such as `test`.
    1. After clicking on _Deploy_, the control panel will display a _Invoke URL_.
1. Test the deployment.
    * Copy the invoke URL and append the method you created previously at the end, like this: `https://woeijfw.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/test/predict`

***WARNING:*** _if you followed the steps above, the API is now public and can be accessed by anyone, which can lead to abuse. Securing the access to your API falls beyond the scope of this course._
